# Feature_Scaling_Implementation

## What is Feature Scaling?
Feature scaling is a data preprocessing technique in machine learning where numerical input features are transformed to a common scale.

## I have used KNN algorithm and SVM algorithm in this 

## What is a KNN algorithm ?
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors — it is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
It is simple, easy to implement, and intuitive.

## What is a SVM algorithm
SVM stands for Support Vector Machine — a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used mainly for classification, and sometimes for regression.
